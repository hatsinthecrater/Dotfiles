# Dotfiles
My dot files for my terminal configuration
Note: This is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to update my configuration files.
This is only the config files and none of the necessary packages or programs that are needed to run these files. WIP


### The dot files that I use for my personalized terminal configuration.
This repo contains my configuration files for starship, .zshrc, NeoVim, yabai, wezterm, and skhd.
